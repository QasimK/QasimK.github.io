A home theatre is ultimately about media consumption: films, TV shows, music, and even games. It can be quick or long to build. It can be cheap, or expensive. It can be low-maintenance, or I-wish-it-was-low-maintenance.

I will almost entirely ignore the media sources: Consoles for gaming, PC for everything, Smart Dongles, software, apps, services for media consumption. Instead, I will focus on the room and equipment possibilities.

## Room Layout

A larger room allows you to have more people watching the larger screen even at the same resolution (e.g. 1080p). A larger room allows you to have more effective surround sound for everyone involved.

For example, the people on the left will be closer to the left speaker. Too close, and the audio experience degrades. Similarly, they will be more off-centre from the screen.

Rear surround - 7.1 - requires a metre or so behind you to be worth it. Ideally, 1/3 (one-third) of the room space should be behind you. This can be difficult!

### Room Lighting

Blacks. Dark.

Control lighting with spotlights, ideally spotlight zones.

## Projector or TV

In 2018, it's a projector if you want to fill your vision.

### Projector

The big downside to a projector is that ambient light washes out the image quite easily. Secondly, you'll need a surface to project on to and a location for the projector to sit.

Ultra short throw projectors have reduced image quality (??), but can prevent shadows when people stand up.

Just pretend it doesn't have any audio output. I doubt any projector sounds good.

Note projector screen electric voltage wire signal to motorise it... 12-volt trigger. The 12-volt trigger can be useful to set the room up: close the curtains, turn off the lights, and lower the projector screen.

Insane Contrast example (boxes, shadow image): https://turbofuture.com/home-theater-audio/How-to-blackout-your-home-theater-cinema-room
Grey Screen absorbs ambient light better, meaning deeper blacks, but it is less vivid.

Consider the gain: high-gain screens have greater brightness drop-offs at wider angles because they reflect more of the energy back towards the centre-line. The centre will appear brighter @ 1.3+ gain. Possible colour shift. (https://www.projectorcentral.com/projector_screens_gain.htm). Half Gain Viewing Angle of 140Â° = 50% brightness compared to centre. This also results in some "hotspotting" - sitting centred, the middle portion appears brighter than edges.

The room lighting is important. Consider automating lights on when pressing pause.

Black border around the screen helps massively with perceived contrast.

DLP vs LCD.

### TV

Smart TVs can suck depending on how much control you want over them.

Audio output control? Does it support 5.1/7.1? Can it do Dolby Atmos?

The advantage is you may not need a receiver at all as you can consider the TV to be a receiver itself. It is smart after all.

## Glossary

An explanatory glossary is necessary because there are so many components that could possibly be involved.

### Audio

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Audio

Object-based sound. What is Dolby XXXX?

LPCM: Blu-Ray decoding required. 27 Mbit/s. <=8 channels.

DTS Digital Surround - Required Blu-ray: 5.1 1.5 Mbit/s.
DTS-HD Master Audio - 8 channels, Optional on Blu Ray
DTS:X (2015) - object-based sound. Up to 32 speaker locations. Not overhead. Adjust dialogue directly. Backwards compatible with DTS-HD Master Audio.
DTS Neo:X - fake surround 2/5.1 -> 11.1.
DTS Virtual:X - fake overhead speakers, post-processing technology only.

Dolby Digital (DD, AC-3) - Up to 6 channels. (Blu-ray: 5.1 640 kbit/s)
Dolby Digital Plus (DD+, E-AC-3, EC-3) - up to 16 channels, Compressed up to 6.144 Mbit/s.
    Decoding optional for blu-ray: 7.1, 4.7 Mbit/s; deployed as extension to AC-3.
Dolby TrueHD (2005) - Up to 16 channels/24 bits/sample/192kHz lossless.
    Blu-ray: Optional, 7.1 channels (+ objects). 18 Mbit/s max.
     Optional Blu Ray (8 channels), up to 14 channels.
Dolby Atmos (2012). Backwards-compatible with Dolby TrueHD

Dolby Pro Logic (II(x/z)) - fake up-mix stereo 5.1 to surround sound/7.1.

THX?

## HDMI CEC and ARC

HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (CEC), allows a single remote control to operate multiple devices. However it is unreliable due to incompatibilities between manufacturers.

HDMI's Audio Return Channel returns the audio backwards over the HDMI cable??

 Return Audio from TV to A/V receiver. Control A/V Receiver (volume) using TV remote. Turn A/V Receiver on by turning the TV on.
What are the limitations on the audio quality of ARC? Source device turns things "on".

HDMI 2.1 will have eARC, which allows uncompressed multi-channel audio to go in both directions.

This is also useful if you use your TV as an HDMI switch instead.
