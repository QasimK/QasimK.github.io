## A/V Receiver

An A/V Receiver is composed of many different components in one convenient package. It is meant to be the heart of your home theatre. It ultimately accepts various Audio/Video sources, outputs to your speakers, and just passes the video through.

* Sources: HDMI, Bluetooth, Radio, Proprietary (AirPlay, Spotify Connect), Internet Radio.
* An HDMI switch
* Audio decoder
* DAC
* Amplifier

Audio/Video switch.

Not actually necessary... What is your source? It is almost always HDMI, let's just assume HDMI.

If you're just using a PC, you can get 5.1 or 7.1 support on motherboards. However, none support Atmos (2018).

If you have another source, like a game console, then perhaps you can get some kind of input pass-through?

An A/V receiver is necessary if you have more than one input source.

Features:

* 6 channel - 5.1
* 8 channel - 5.1.2, 7.1
* 10 channel - 5.1.4, 7.1.2, 9.1
* etc. upto 24.1.10

The 1st digit: centre channel, left and right front, left and right side (surround, ear level), left and right rear (ear level), front left and right height

The second digit is a sub-woofer for the bass. LFE channel (Low-frequency effects). Up-to 100-200Hz.

The 3rd digit is overheard (ceiling, or ceiling-reflected "Atmos-enabled") speakers. Left/right
It is only useful with Dolby Atmos.
Atmos-enabled are angled, upward firing speakers.

* PC bit-stream pass through via HDMI ignores your PC's audio processing completely.
* Otherwise you need a sound-card that supports Atmos. For example, if you have connected the speakers directly to your PC.

There are other audio streams (usually always Dolby): TrueHD, DTS, DTS:X (2015), ... I have no idea.

### Pre-amp

eg. For the sub-woofer that is powered by itself.


### Headphones

You may want to connect head-phones wirelessly (wired?) to not disturb others.
What is the quality over Bluetooth? DAC.

#### DRM, HDCP

Note: Due to Digital Rights Management (DRM), i.e. HDCP, this is harder than it needs to be.
This isn't an issue if you aren't using an "official app" like "Netflix" which loves DRM and makes your life painful if you don't have the perfect hardware.
Note: It isn't Netflix's fault - it's the fault of the media producers.

HDMI 2.1 is coming out. Is it worth waiting for a receiver that can support that at least.
Since 4K is more than sufficient for any home, the reason to wait would be to support > 60Hz.
Overall, for a living room or home theatre, it is not worth it. Gaming-wise, on a TV, I don't think so.
Unless you're playing FPSs with a mouse and keyboard in there.

And this bloody thing is why is takes several seconds to switch to a new HDMI source/change resolution etc.
Should be fixed in HDMI 2.1 though.

### Second Output (Zone)

You may want a second HDMI output to watch or listen to the same thing in another room "party mode".
Or even, switch between TV and Projector easily.

There may be a feature to replicate the audio-stream using a couple of channels to another room (degrading the main room).

It may be possible to watch or listen to something else in another room using the same A/V receiver.

### Multi-room Audio

Whew... good luck. Do you really need or want it?

Note: wireless second zone option.

Can you control the A/V receiver from the second room? Not with remote, but App on phone.
You can with remote (need second remote?) if you use a second infrared signal receiver.

### The speakers

Passive vs Active. Powered vs unpowered. Power of A/V receiver to amplify signal to drive speakers.

Distance = delay setting (speakers output at same time)
Level = Volume.

Wireless speakers? Let's not even go there. They either need a power cable, or a battery, and both are awful.
NB: Not tried it personally.

### Wired input

MHL? what is it?

### Wireless connection

Want to play something from your phone?

Bluetooth. Spotify Connect. Airplay. Google Cast. Miracast?

AM/FM Radio tuners!? Useless... UK - DAB (Digital Audio Broadcast) and DAB+... also useless.
But more useless than radio is... Phono.

Be wary of getting hacked if it is internet-connected though!
Also.. does it have web browser control?

Other sources: PCs/NAS/iTunes, USB.

### The remote

It has a remote.

### Automatic speaker calibration (tuning)

Can it automatically tune the speaker outputs for an optimal experience?

Can you do it manually?

### bi-amping

Use two additional channels of A/V receiver to split front-speakers tweeter and woofer. Don't bother.
