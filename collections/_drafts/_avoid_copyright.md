# Copyright is making the world a worse place to live

It is making it less sociable, less competitive, and less free. I should explain in detail why I think this here.

So, avoid copyright?

Or more specifically, avoid giving your money to large corporations who push for [stringent copyright laws](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/today-europe-lost-internet-now-we-fight-back) that prevent the world from becoming a better place to live.

* Are you spending money on big films?
* Are you spending money on music from big labels?
* Are you spending money on watching exclusive sporting events?
* Are you spending money on merchandise for media?

That money goes to lobbying to create laws that (they think) will make them more money. (I think they're wrong about that but that may be a digression.)

For games, there are places like GOG.
