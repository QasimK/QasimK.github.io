# TODO: Add update for improved Texture Packs https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2019/02/01/dolphin-progress-report-dec-2018-and-jan-2019/#50-9217-implement-resource-packs-by-spycrab

The Nintendo Wii is my favourite game console because of its innovative controllers. While *Breath of the Wild* is absolutely stunning on the Nintendo Switch, I miss *Skyward Sword*'s use of the motion controller. It's *the* reason I'm looking forward to VR games: the ability to actually use your entire body to play instead of just your fingers.

It's possible to play pretty much all of your Wii games on your PC now. It can be a little bit inconvenient to keep the 2006 Wii plugged-in ready to go all the way here in 2018, especially with the its use of older video cables[^speakers]. The [Dolphin Emulator][dolphin-site] is a great solution reducing the number of components you have to manage. Perhaps more significantly, it allows you to play the games at 1080p @ 60fps (and better) rather than ~480p @ 30fps! That resolution and frame rate was awful back in 2006, now it's just painful.

## Dolphin

It's a cross-platform emulator[^android], and *almost* straightforward to set up. The [Dolphin Wiki][dolphin-wiki] contains most of the information you need, but the [Dolphin Forums][dolphin-forums] contain additional user guides and resources.

Assuming you don't know what a DVD drive is any more, you'll want to obtain ISOs (or lossless compression file formats: WBFS, GCZ or CISO/CSO). ISOs are `dd` copies of the disk. TODO: CISO (compact ISO). WBFS (Wii Backup File System). GCZ (GameCube Zip). Generally use the compressed versions. The Wiki has a page on getting ISOs from your game discs using the Wii. They simply go into a folder, and you tell Dolphin where that folder is.

Here are some resources if you are interested in the differences between `.gcm`, `.iso`, `.gcz`, `.ciso`, `.wbfs` (all supported), and `.wia` (not supported by Dolphin in 2018): [1a][formats-1a], [1b][formats-1b], [2a][formats-2a], [2b][formats-2b], [2c][formats-2c], [2d][formats-2d], [3][formats-3]. Ultimately, it doesn't really make a difference.

TODO: Screenshot following...

The Game ID and PAL/NTSC variants of the same game may be significant. Once added to Dolphin, the Game ID can be found by: Right Click Game > ISO Properties.

## The Game Controllers

Dolphin supports a variety of inputs including the original Wiimotes (Plus) + Nunchuks, the Balance Board, GameCube Controllers, keyboard and mouse, and other standard controllers.

It's possible to play even Super Mario Galaxy with a standard controller by also using the mouse as the Wiimote pointer. However, other games like Red Steel may be much easier to get started with by having the Wiimote Plus (or Wiimote + Wii Motion Plus add-on) due to their use of the motion sensor. Some [workarounds][wiimote-plus-workarounds] *may* exist. if you don't have these While I started with *Logitech's F710 Game Controllers*, I never got very far because manually configuring the key maps was driving me crazy.

TODO: Official MotionPlus support is added: https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2019/04/26/mastering-motion/

To save my sanity, I decided to get the WiiMotes that I already had working.

The original sensor bar is merely a passive infrared-light emitter (IR emitter), which is powered via a proprietary cable. It is possible to [adapt the proprietary connector][convert-sensor] into a USB connector. In addition to this, the Wiimotes are connected via Bluetooth. Therefore, you don't need much more than just your original equipment, but I had two issues with this.

Firstly, adapting the connector sounded just a tiny bit dangerous. An alternative is a cheap passive IR emitter, either battery-powered or USB-powered. Battery-powered may be particularly convenient for certain set-ups where your PC is not near your display (e.g. projectors).

Secondly, my computer didn't even have Bluetooth. It's possible to purchase a simple Bluetooth adaptor, but there could be compatibility issues (people have encountered these due to problems with their Bluetooth hardware or software).

I decided to get the *MayFlash W010 Dolphin Bar - Wireless Wii Remote Sensor for USB*, a combined IR emitter + Bluetooth adapter. It worked out of the box immediately. It's been out many years so a [firmware update][mayflash-firmware] is unlikely to be necessary. I went through the effort anyway, although to no avail.

The Dolphin Bar has a few additional features, so this [cheat-sheet and instructions booklet][dolphinbar-cheatsheet] may be handy.

## Further Game Improvements

### HD Textures

It's possible (and I'd strongly recommend) to increase the texture resolution with [**custom textures**][forum-custom-textures]. These should be placed in Dolphin's user directory under `Load/Textures/[Game ID]/`.

For example, there is a [Mario Kart Wii HD Remaster][mario-kart-wii-hd] project. This is mentioned in the game's Wiki page. However, the front-page doesn't always have the latest download because sometimes other people make further improvements while the thread owner is MIA. For Mario Kart Wii, there are additional improvements on [Page 5][mario-kart-hd-pg-5].

Similarly with Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2. As of mid-2018, [BigHead's packs][smg-bighead] were the latest improvements ([direct link][smg-bighead-direct-link]). The release notes for these updates can be very hard to track down as they are not on the front-page.

### 60+ FPS

Further, it's possible (and I'd strongly recommend) to increase the frame-rate, usually from **30 FPS to 60 FPS**. If instructions are not on the game's wiki page, then the [60 FPS master list][60-fps-master-list] is the place to go. This is done with "AR codes" which can be enabled by adding them to: Right Click Game > Properties > AR Codes.

TODO: Screenshot of AR Code windows.

Be aware that PAL and NTSC game versions may use different codes.

For example, with Mario Kart Wii it's possible to [lift the 30 FPS limit][mario-kart-wii-60-fps] found for split-screen multiplayer to match the 60 FPS that is the default when in single player mode. The following (PAL) AR code is added the game:

```
004250D4 00000001
0029FD69 00000000
```

### Ishiiruka

Finally, there exists [Ishiiruka][ishiiruka]. A fork of Dolphin with significant new graphical capabilities, modifications for compatibility with older machines, and other additional features. It adds some new capabilities that require special Texture Packs to make use of. Since it's a fork, and seriously lacks a usage guide, I haven't touched it.

## Per-Game Overrides

Sometimes a particular game will not perform very well. In these cases, the settings for that particular game can be overridden. I found a [forum thread on gameini settings][forum-game-overrides] to be useful.

    title="To access the game overrides: Right-Click [Game] > Properties > Edit User Config."

For example, for Super Mario Galaxy I reduced the internal resolution down from 1080p to 720p, but increased the MSAA to compensate:

```
[Video_Settings]
InternalResolution=2
MSAA=2
```


[^speakers]: RCA/SCART/Component, what are these things!? In particular for me, my 5.1 speaker system is only connected to the PC, so by using the PC I can continue to avoid getting an AV receiver.
[^android]: Dolphin even works on Android.
