I switched from the ThinkPad X1 Carbon to the Dell XPS 13 because Lenovo did not offer a ThinkPad that supported the 5120 x 1440 resolution this year. I recently started using a 49" monitor and it turns out that only Intel's 10th Gen Ice Lake processors can output at this resolution—not even Comet Lake (same year processors) can do this.

The new laptop is smaller in every dimension. The screen uses a 16:10 aspect ratio and the bezels are very small. In comparison the Thinkpad had a thick bezel at the top and an even thicker bezel at the bottom. There is a USB Type-C port on both sides of the laptop. The body is more sturdy.

The keyboard and touchpad are about the same. The arrow keys are not arranged well. There is no microphone mute button. There are no dedicated home, end, page up and page down keys. The keyboard backlight is very uneven. The touchpad experience is not as good as the Macbook; this is probably down to the user interface toolkit rather than the hardware.

There is no privacy shutter on the camera. There is no HDMI port and no adapter is given. There are no USB Type-A ports, but one adapter is given. There is no Kensington Lock, but it turns out I never used it anyway.

There is a fingerprint sensor and support for Windows Hello, neither of which I intend to use.

Overall, for me, the most significant difference is the inclusion of a 16:10 screen and a processor that supports higher output display resolutions. Otherwise, the ThinkPad would easily have been my preferred choice.

On the firmware side of things, Dell's UEFI radically different—in a bad way. Mostly because there is a mouse cursor that doesn't click on anything and cannot scroll. Otherwise, I think Dell offers more customisation more directly from the firmware which may help with cross-platform support.
