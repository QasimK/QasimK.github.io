GDPR is my favourite law during my lifetime that I am aware of. Previously, it
was the regulations around data roaming in the EU.

Your personal data is likely to be all over the place. In particular, I have
received emails from organisations that I have never heard of.

Someone has written a [Subject Access Request letter][letter] that allows you
to get all of the personal data that someone holds on you.

Despite these protections, I still recommend using fake or alternative personal
information wherever possible. Unless you expect deliveries, don't provide your
address. Unless you envision a phone call, don't provide your phone number.
Unless they need to verify your identity, don't provide your name or date of birth.
Don't use a phone number for 2FA unless they need it for identify verification anyway.

This information can be used for identify theft or to create profiles about you
without your knowledge. It's just not worth the risk, or the risk of receiving spam.
Do you want to be targeted without your knowledge? For example, be shown higher
prices on products compared to other people?
