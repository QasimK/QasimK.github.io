## Room Acoustics is the most important

Note Audio Quality: https://www.crutchfield.com/S-S1fHSjc0pcy/learn/room-acoustics-home-audio.html

## Speaker Cable

Aim for < 5% resistance compared to speaker minimum impedance. (50% = 3dB, 11% = 1dB. 5% = 0.5dB.)

Note speaker impedance varies with frequency.

<Insert Graph>. 1.5mm diameter is probably okay. 2.5mm is overkill.

You may not want overkill because the wire is more unwieldy and expensive.

### Subwoofer

Subwoofer is RCA cable, because it is line-out (pre-amp).

## Bookshelf vs Floor-standing.

In general floor-standing speakers are worse value-for-money.

They have better bass, but this will be handled by subwoofer.

They might be used for music, but for home theatre, bookshelves are the way to go.
