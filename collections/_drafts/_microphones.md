Microphone
==========

Microphone signal = 1-100 microvolts.

Too low for the next device - need to boost to "line level".

Microphone preamplifier will do this.

Dynamic & Condenser microphones.

* Dynamic usually have much lower signal
* Dynamic has self-noise = thermal noise
* Thus Dynamic has a noise level (not usually stated) (noise sbl)
* Dynamic is less sensitive, requiring ~50-70dB boost

* Condenser has a stated comparable noise level
* Condenser is more sensitive, requiring ~30-50dB boost

* Dynamic are susceptible to plosives when placed near to mouth due to "physics"
* Dynamic records bass more heavily when placed near sound due to "physics"

Many microphones have a preamp built-in.

Boosting microphone signal is called "applying gain".

SNR increases with increased gain, but flattens out near the top-end.

Some leeway is required(?) to prevent clipping.

So want high gain setting (to -12 - -18 db level)


Preamps usually(?) introduce a higher noise level relative to microphones.
