I've had the Kindle Voyage for over two years.

I did a software upgrade this week (5.6.x (?) -> 5.10.1.1), because I thought it was about time to fix the little annoyances.

It is awful that I have to scour the internet to find out how Amazon is going to screw you over with the updates. Not if. How. That is the sad state of technology these days.

I did my due diligence and discovered the new home screen sucks. It has "personalised" content, another way of saying here's some ads shoved down your throat.

Apparently there was supposed to be a way to turn these off. But lo and behold, you can only do that if you login to your Amazon account.

Seriously, screw you Amazon.

Is it so hard to have a home screen that just lists my books?!

Two-thirds of the home screen is useless if you have not logged in to an Amazon account. Literally Useless.

Here is another blog post complaining: https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2016/02/13/the-new-kindle-homescreen-sucks-its-just-one-big-ad/

Prior to the upgrade, only half of the home screen was useless, and you at least had a picture of a person reading under a tree in the useless half.

The good news is:

* The Kindle seems more responsive and quicker at turning pages.
* It seems to have less touch-typing and text-selecting bugs.
* There are significant improvements in the UI when actually reading a book.

But why can we still not set our own custom sleep wallpapers, or have the option to set it to the cover of the currently reading book?

Perhaps, I should have just jailbroken my Kindle rather than upgrading it past the point of no return (5.8.8).

Overall... it is worth the upgrade, but you might want to consider going to 5.7.1 which does not have the new home screen.
