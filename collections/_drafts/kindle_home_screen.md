This is a bit of a belated rant on at Amazon did to the Kindle Voyage e-reader (and likely their other devices too). In general, it reminds me of the adage: "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".

I've been long trained to do software updates for security reasons, and I suppose I was getting a little bored of the static Kindle Voyage and the *small little* annoyances it had. So, I thought it was time to do the first software update.

Now, I'm no stranger to getting screwed over by new versions of software. Though, this has tended to be what I've heard from other people rather than being directly affected. So, I scoured the internet to see how Amazon was going to screw me over.



I did a software upgrade from v5.6 to v5.10.1.1 because I thought it was about time to fix the *little* annoyances. I cannot really remember what they were now though, because they've been long overshadowed by new *big* annoyances.

I did my due diligence and discovered the new home screen sucks. It has "personalised" content, another way of saying here's some ads shoved down your throat.

Mind you, and this is really important to point out, I paid for the ad-free version of the device. In my books, forced "personalised content" **is** ads. There are no two ways about it.

Apparently there was supposed to be a way to turn these off, so I went ahead and did the upgrade.

Lo and behold, I discovered you can only turn off these ads if you login to your Amazon account.

Now, I don't see these ads because I never connect my Kindle to the internet. This rant should clearly exemplify why.





Is it so hard to have a home screen that just lists my books?!

Two-thirds of the home screen is useless if you have not logged in to an Amazon account. Literally Useless.

Here is another blog post complaining: https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2016/02/13/the-new-kindle-homescreen-sucks-its-just-one-big-ad/

Prior to the upgrade, only half of the home screen was useless, and you at least had a picture of a person reading under a tree in the useless half.

The good news is:

* The Kindle seems more responsive and quicker at turning pages.
* It seems to have less touch-typing and text-selecting bugs.
* There are significant improvements in the UI when actually reading a book.

But why can we still not set our own custom sleep wallpapers, or have the option to set it to the cover of the currently reading book?

Perhaps, I should have just jailbroken my Kindle rather than upgrading it past the point of no return (5.8.8).

Overall... it is worth the upgrade, but you might want to consider going to 5.7.1 which does not have the new home screen.
