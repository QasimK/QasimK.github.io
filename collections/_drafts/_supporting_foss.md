# Supporting FOSS via donations

It seems more expensive than most proprietary software! LOL!

Minimise payment processing fees by donating annually. Why does this matter?
If you donate to 11 projects each month, then the base fee over the year is $0.30 * 11 * 12 = $39.60.
If you donate to 11 projects over the year, then the base fee is $3.30.
So you save $36.30 - enough to find that 12th project.

Do Patreon and LiberaPay batch payments? Unknown.
