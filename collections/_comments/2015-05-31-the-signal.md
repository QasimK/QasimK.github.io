It starts off as horror, transforms into a mystery and then ends with the most ridiculous attempt to blow your mind.

It was *meh* because the ending leaves much to be desired. You really don't understand the motivations of these aliens. Perhaps the point is to leave you thinking, but the only thing I was left thinking was "why?".
