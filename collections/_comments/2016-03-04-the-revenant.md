Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar (finally) for this film. However, the film itself was quite boring.

The ending is bitter-sweet, but on top of that you feel - what was the point of this?

I suppose it tells you quite well what vengenace will get you. It is a moral in the consequences of revenge. You work for it, you spend so much time on it and then when it happens nothing. You don't feel any better. I know I certainly didn't feel better.

I think that's why I didn't like the film. The "sweet" part of bitter-sweet wasn't sweet because it didn't exist at all.
