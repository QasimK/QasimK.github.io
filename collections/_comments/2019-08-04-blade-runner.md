I think it is the style of older films to be slow. It reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
It didn't help that I was tired at the time. Overall, it was not great, but not terrible
either. In some ways, I liked the slow-pace, the shots just looking at something.

An interesting ending, I think it's ambiguous on whether the protagonist was a replicant.
