Fast and Furious 7 was surprisingly good but only because I went in with low expectations. That was because of a combination of thinking I didn't find the first or second *that* good and it seemed like transformers (in quality/audience). I understood the film generally even though it had some strong links to previous films.

The opening characterises what was good about the film - awesome and bad-ass scenes. I can forgive just how unrealistic they are because they are just cool. You will have to forget about just how fake scene after scene is though (and by the end I had to consciously do this).

The film had a theme about family. The primary antagonist did what he did to get revenge for what happened to his younger brother (in a previous film). The protagonists fought to protect their own families and friends. It did not feel particularly tacked on even without having watched previous films.

I don't recall any particularly bad moments except those where I thought, yep this is happening this way just to create some "cool" scenes or a little bit of fake tension.

The frivolousness of rich people as portrayed in perhaps a single scene did make me surprisingly mad. I think I just thought imagine what good could happen if these people in real life had different priorities.

Overall though I would rate this as *meh* because it is a good time-waster if you don't go in with high expectations.
