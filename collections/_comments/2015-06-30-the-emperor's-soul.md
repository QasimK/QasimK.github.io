Another great fantasy book by Brandon Sanderson. In this case, it is a short novella that was bound together with *Legion* into a single book. Both has unusual systems of magic, and both made them work well.

This story was supposedly set in Sel, the same world as in Elantris, although I didn't see/remember enough to see the connection. Here Shai is forced to forge the soul, the mind, of the emperor Ashraven after having been captured.

I liked the characters which felt real. The story itself was interesting, and I liked the way it unfoled; we discovered one layer at a time of something. This does seem to be Sanderson's writing style.

Shai, however, seemed a little too smart - there was practically no curve-ball thrown her way in this story, and she understood every character practically inside-out. Although, granted, it is her life's work to understand people and objects.

It was good. 3/4. I wish Sanderson expands upon this.
