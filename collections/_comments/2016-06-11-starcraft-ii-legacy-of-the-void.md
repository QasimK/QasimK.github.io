Legacy of the Void is the final part of the Starcraft 2 story, and it delivers an epic ending which tries to tie everything together. It is helpful to have a good memory of the earlier games because there is very little to refresh your memory of key characters; I felt like I missing part of the story (Duran/Narud?).

The game starts of really well, almost immediately putting you on the back-foot. This *is* an epic start with real consequences, showing Artanis, the main Protagonist, is fallible from the get-go.

That's the high point. From here, you enter a repetitive formula reminescent of the earlier games but with less liveliness. You have no forces, so you must re-build them by making allies again and again and again with some occassional strategic objective thrown in. To top it off, conversations on the ships are not engaging, and the characters are mostly flat. While it is not new that there are no consequences to what they are saying, I just didn't care this time.

Then, finally you get to the finale and things liven up again. The epilogue ending really puts the finishing touches to the saga. The real issue overall is that, for the most part, the Protoss campaign is about the Protoss and not about ending the saga. Most of the missions you complete are just filler (build up your forces), and the important story points (such as intertwining the previous two story lines with Raynoy and Kerrigan) and barely touched upon until the end, where upon they do not receive the time that they need.

It is a disappointing conclusion to the story, albeit satisfying.

Kerigan's forces are wiped out, and the dominion is under seige from the Moebius Foundation. That is ridiculous after all the effort I put in the previous two games.

- The underwhelming effects. It seems like some characters, ships and races vary radically in the amount of power they can employ.
- Protoss have the power to destroy planets but that is never really used by the player.
- It was a nice ending to have the combined Spear of Adun/Purifier/Nerazim/Tal'darim forces destroy Amon.

## Themes

### Khalai vs Individual Freedom

- Throw off the caste system
- Destroy their connection to the Khala
- Artanis was very "freedom", "freedom", "freedom" and quick to dismiss the Khala. Which wasn't related to the caste system, but was a valid "freedom" point

### Purifiers and AI

- A minor plot point about slavery of AIs and not treating them as people
