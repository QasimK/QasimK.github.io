*How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed* (Ray Kurzweil) is about Kurzweil's idea on how the human mind learns. The core concept is the **Pattern Theory Recognition of the Mind** (PTRM). He also covered topics like creativity, how human vision might work, but one aspect which I thought required much more detail was how emotions existed (the 'old brain'). He used thought experiments and real experiments to back up his theory.

PTRM is essentially that the intelligence portion of the mind has a fundamental block (composed of maybe a hundred neurons), a pattern recogniser, that is repeated many times. They form connections in a grid-like manner. When a pattern recogniser is activated (by incoming axons/dendrites), it then fires upwards its own outward connections.

This is then expanded to explain, for example, what a pattern is (anything) and the hierarchy that allows for complex patterns. For example, a pattern would recognise individual bits of a letter, fire upwards to signal another pattern which recognises a letter, which fires upwards to another pattern for a particular word. If that pattern crosses a threshold then a 'word' is recognised which is done by *that* pattern firing upwards.

It was not entirely clear (somewhat due to my skim reading) how concepts like feelings worked. He also stated there could be *some* level of specialisation naturally, for example, with vision but due to the re-programmability of the mind it is limited.

He also described the structure of the brain although it was *very* unclear. Further, he linked his theory to his own work on speech recognition in the 80s/90s and showed how they were similar. In addition, he claimed that the exponential increase in computational power will mean human-level of intelligence in the 2020s [note: [IBM Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_%28computer%29) won Jeopardy in 2011].

I think I need a second reading of this book soon to understand the latter half in particular.
