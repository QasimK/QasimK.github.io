A thrilling tale of a botanist/engineer who becomes stranded on Mars. The use of logical thinking and science is a step above most science-fiction-type films (I can't comment on books since I've read hardly any of them). The challenges that come up are engaging since you wonder how he is going to solve them - and you are practically certain that he *will* survive to the end of the book.

I listened to the audiobook, and it was excellent. The reader spoke parts of the book better than I would have read them. He had an excellent understanding of (some of) the characters. I cannot say there were any faults except the perhaps stereotypical voices of some characters (based on their names I suspect). This, alongside the voices of the female characters, is a limitation of him being only one man.

At times I was on the edge of my metaphorical seat, far more than the number of times I was dozing off. Granted I did almost skip a couple of minutes a couple of times, but that's my impatience for you! With my general understanding of science, I did not feel that anything was dumbed down â€” I think most people could understand it, but whether they would enjoy it I'm not as sure.

Interestingly the book was initially just an ebook, before having an audiobook make a couple of years later, then finally a hardcover the following year.

I heard about this book from the trailer of the film adaptation. I wonder if the film will do it justice.
