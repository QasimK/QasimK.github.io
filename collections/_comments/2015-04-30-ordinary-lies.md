Ordinary Lies is a BBC TV show I watched on iPlayer. It explores similar themes to the writer's previous works, namely about the deceptions, lies and fa√ßades that ordinary people can create in ordinary situations.

In ordinary lies the situations portrayed happen quite often in real life, but they are extra-ordinary here since they happen over the matter of a few weeks to different people at the same workplace.

The episodes are mostly self-contained with a little bit of hints of other story threads that happen later.

- Episode 1: (Someone) pretended is wife died
- Episode 2: ??
- Episode 3: ? Drug holiday?
- Episode 4: (Someone else) lost his home and...
- Episode 5: Pete's gambling addiction reveals his secret family
- Episode 6: Beth's husband is found (spoiler: he had a mental breakdown and ran away)

I thought this show was *good* because it had interesting stories with characters put in interesting situations in which you could just tell the point at which they *almost-understandably* tell a lie that will go spiralling out of control.
