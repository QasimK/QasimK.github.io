The final book in the Reckoners Series. The one that finally, more or less, answers the questions. Disappointingly.

The book *is* good, but not up to the same level as the previous two. It follows the same general formula, but in another city, a different villian, a different set of powers to deal with, and more interpersonal conflicts.

That is precisely why the ending was disappointing. The focus of the book was not to wrap up the series, it was wrapped up hastily in one little chapter towards the end that didn't really have anything to do with the rest of the book. (It was a little tough to understand the explanation too.)

Overall, I'll rate it good but it really hangs off the shoulders of its predecessors.
