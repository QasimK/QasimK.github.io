A book in The Culture series. It describes a possible "utopian" society, one which can still have challenges, plots and ennui. There is a small amount of telling, but it is mostly showing without feeling like expoistion.

The only protagonist, Jernau Morat Gurgeh, is not particularly likable and his morals are tested whether by what he does, or what he chooses to not do. The story follows his life of playing games within The Culture.

I liked the setting, for obvious reasons, which seems to be functional despite, and over time you learn more about how it functions. Some parts of the book did just seem like slice-of-life, which I suppose was part of the point. By following Jernau we didn't have an epic story, something Jernau mentions himself, although by the end we realise there was something epic happening.

We also *see* at the end, despite everything working out just fine, that, really, The culture is idyllic *despite* the very high potential for it to have not turned out this way.
