Made in 1968. Watched in 2015. I was utterly blown away by how good it looked. It could have been made this decade.

Until it starts dragging on. The entire thing must have been utterly amazing in 1968 when space flight was in its early stages and the moon-landings were yet to come. However, in 2015 it is just painfully slow. We already know how space works and none of this is new.

The entire first half (over an hour) is a set-up to the real film in the second half. It shoves in your face scenes about magnetic boots, cylindrical ships (with artificial gravity) and a futuristic setting. It is like a documentary about what the future will be like by showing you *(and not telling you)*.

However, it is amazing what I did see. 1968!

Communicating via voice with computers. Artificial intelligence which is an extension of human powers. The accuracy of portrayal of space. The tell-tale red light of a evil AI. The music score! You can instantly see how many *things* originated from this film (the AI even reminded me of GLADOS).

They were all interesting to see, but the real substance of the film fell short. The god-awful first half. It starts off with 3 minutes of a black screen. Yep. I kid you not. Then it moves onto apes & cavemen for 10-20 minutes. I'm not going to write any more. It was just boring.

The second half had boring moments too, but it was much more exciting overall. Seeing how the explorer dealt with a potentially faulty AI, then how he dealt with a murderous AI were truly gripping scenes and showed just how human-like his character was. It almost lets me forgive the mundane scenes (*"they too show how human-like the characters are in how mundane life is most of the time"* or something like that).

The ending was a mess and made no sense.

There is a sequel. I was told to not bother. I won't bother. 2/4 with the proviso that this is a **must-watch**.
