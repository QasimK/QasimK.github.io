Interstellar is an *awesome* film.

I went in hyped because of the teaser trailer and knowing it was Christopher Nolan and somehow I came out hyped even more.

This was probably as close to perfect as you can get.

Special note for Hans Zimmer the compose of that *awesome* soundtrack.

Granted, I try to avoid thinking about any potential plot-holes (I absolutely did not notice any while watching the film).

Hands-down, 4/4.
