Bastion was *awesome*, remember-able and thus becomes one of my favourite games. I liked the story, I liked how the story *was told*, the game mechanics were good, challenging and you could control how challenging (by being able to ramp *up* the difficulty)! There is some re-playability with "new game plus" which I have not tried.
