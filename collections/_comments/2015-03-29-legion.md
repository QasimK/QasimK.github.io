Legion is about a man who can create (?) *aspects* which are hallucinations with a particular trait and a complete personality. For example, one is a very knowledgeable gun enthusiast and another a linguist who can translate languages.

The story in this book had an interesting book-arc, in addition to hints of a long-term arc. Once again, the author explores an interesting system of magic(-like systems), although in this case it is limited to one person and a particular Sci-Fi object which the book is concerned with.

The characters are interesting and over the course of the novella they become fleshed out. I liked his relationships with the aspects and the particular way in which they are helpful to him while still being their own persons. I found the pretend-they-are-real parts to be funny.

There was not any particular part of this book that I disliked.

Overall, this book was good and I want to read a sequel. Fortunately it does seem like there is one (Legion: Skin Deep, twice the length), and there may be a third in the future.
