This was a very smooth spy film featuring a very young adult coming from a poor background. There were many cool moments but only a few moments trying to be cool. In fact, they were probably deliberate (and you knew they were) since the film was somewhat of a parody of a spy film with meta-references to the genre and going over the top.

I liked how many things tied together through the use of foreshadowing and Chekhov's Gun. Even though the plot was somewhat straightforward, with perhaps only one minor twist, I quite liked the characters and dilemmas that appeared.

It is not a surprise (but still disappointing) that there was no strong female character. There was only one possibility and she got relegated to a minor role in the climax despite beating the main character in the selection process. (Perhaps understandable if only given his higher level of involvement and accomplishment with the mission at that point.) Also, that ending was not very nice -.-

Post-credits scene was an example of a cool moment trying to be cool. It was good. Also, I will randomly note now the church scene which was **utterly** ***full*** of violence (it was too much for me).

Overall, I would give this film a rating of 3/4 - it is good.
