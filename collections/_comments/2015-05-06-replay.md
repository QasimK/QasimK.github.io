Replay was about a couple of people who started replaying their lives going back about 25 years, and then going back increasingly shorter periods of time dying at the same moment.

It was great the first replay where he got his wealth, or the second where he got his family, but eventually like the main character you too start to think life is pointless and hollow.

It had some adult material and overall I would give it a 2/4 despite the interesting themes it tried to explore.
