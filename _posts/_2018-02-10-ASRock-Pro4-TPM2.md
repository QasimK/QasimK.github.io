ASRock H97M Pro4 can support ASRock's TPMs-2, with a special UEFI 2.10c. Boot times are increased significantly (though I don't know what boot times are like with TPMs-1). It may necessary to use the v2 module.

I emailed ASRock to get it. Found this thread: forum.asrock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=5746
