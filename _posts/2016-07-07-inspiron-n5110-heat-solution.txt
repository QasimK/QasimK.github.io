- Dust build up in fan grill was not visible externally. The fan itself had to be unscrewed from the grill to see it.
- The thermal compound was not particularly dry. I replaced the GPU and CPU.
- The thermal pads became dusty easily and I did not have any replacement.
- I filled up some holes to prevent air from reaching the keyboard.
- The chipset is on the top side of the motherboard, underneath the left palm rest area below the keyboard.
    - This heats up significantly because there is no cooling for it.

- The heat issues are mostly solved except for the chipset which is irritating.
- I had a peak temperature drop of 10-20°C (2 consecutive runs of each Unigine Heaven and Cinebench)
- No significant drop in Idle temperatures.

- I used HwInfo64(?) to control the fan speed (2 settings only ~3000 and ~5000)
    - Idle tempeatures hit about 40-45°C and I did not achieve a significant drop by using a custom aggressive fan profile.
    - The chipset did not cool down (grr)

Side notes:
- Battery is on 60% capacity after five years.
