# Theoretical Insight into Infrared Heating for Homes.

Central heating costs vs Infrared heating costs.
Initial purchase cost vs you-already-have-central-heating.
Maintenance - lifespan cost.

Gas costs 1/3 of electricity. (Inc. central heating efficiency of 90% with a modern boiler, and 100% efficiency for heating).

What about a central Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system?
This can be more efficient (more than 100%), and may be much more worthwhile in
draught-free home.
